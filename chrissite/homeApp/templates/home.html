					<div id="about"><h3>About</h3><p>Christian Eason is currently a student at the University of the Arts. He discovered his vocal abilities at the age of 10 while living with just his mother. As a baby Christian was raised by two women and currently calls both women “mom”. One of the biggest struggles for Christian was not having a father present in his life. His mother, Lenore Eason began to take on foster care, and Christian quickly became a father figure or and older brother for these young children that were coming in and out of his home. Christian uses the emotions of his father to really connect to his music and push him forward in life to one finally meet him, because his father doesn’t even know he exists.<br><br>  In 2007 Christian moved to Marietta, Georgia to spend time with his only sibling Coolta Eason who has been absent from his life since he was a baby. The age differences between them two kept them separated, but she became a huge mentor for him and an inspiration. In 2013 Christian began coaching cheerleading for an All Star Gym, Dynasty Spirit Elite AllStars. He also began working as a singing busboy at the Walnut Street Supper Club in Philadelphia.<br><br>
   In 2009 Christian moved back to Philadelphia and with the help of mentors Virginia Lam, and Jason Ikeem Rodgers, he could pursue a life in music.  He attended a music high school and soon was rewarded Musician of the year in the Philadelphia School District.
